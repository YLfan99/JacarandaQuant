# 📊 Quantitative Trading Research - JacarandaQuant

Welcome to my **Quantitative Trading Research** repository! The name **Jacaranda** is in memory of the society I founded during my study at the University of Melbourne. I met a lot of fancy friends and coworkers there. Some contents of my research presented in this repo are based on our regular and frequent discussion.

🚀 This project is dedicated to exploring various aspects of quantitative finance, with components like a **backtesting framework**, a **real-time trading framework**, and **quantitative research experiments**. My goal is to provide a modular and powerful toolkit for developing, testing, and deploying trading strategies. While it would be convenient to fit the process in a common framework, the unique structure of each assets markets requires slightly different modifications of the codes. Hence we also put trading assets specific works here to resolve differences in api and trading platforms.

## 🔍 Introduction

This repository contains my **personal research** on **quantitative trading**. It includes:
- A **backtesting framework** for simulating strategies on historical data 📊.
- A **real-time trading framework** for live market execution 🕒.
- A collection of **research and experimental strategies** for quantitative analysis 🧬.

The aim is to build a **robust, extensible, and scalable base** for anyone interested in the field of algorithmic and quantitative trading. Well, not really. My primary goal is follow the simple nature of humanity that making money and enjoying life with that. I did earn a little bit from those, but not as much as expected. Hopefully who sees this repo is more lucky than me and making his life easier.
